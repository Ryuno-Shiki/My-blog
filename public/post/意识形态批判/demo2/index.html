————Comment on a &ldquo;Soviet tramp&rdquo; style of cancellationism</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Part I: Stalin&rsquo;s system - the historical inevitability of &ldquo;good intention&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;tramp&rdquo; comrade first asserted that Stalin&rsquo;s greatest credit was to proposing an &ldquo;economic system adapted to Marxism&rdquo; and believed that &ldquo;at least proved that most of his workable during the socialist period&rdquo;. Subsequently, for the Great Purge and the Katyn Forest incident, he threw out a classic defense formula: &ldquo;It is essentially good, but the execution is indeed bad&rdquo;, and this &ldquo;bad execution&rdquo; was also &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in the environment at that time.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful ideological closed loop. This kind of &ldquo;good intentions&rdquo; discussion is the core deception mechanism of ideology. It first abstracts a complex and inherently contradictory historical process into a pure and well-intentioned &ldquo;idea&rdquo; or &ldquo;plan&rdquo;. Then, all the disastrous consequences in historical practice - the cruel expansion of the purge, the rigidization and dehumanization of the economic system in the later stage - are attributed to external accidental factors or technical mistakes at the execution level (&ldquo;bad execution&rdquo; and &ldquo;the environment at that time&rdquo;), thus protecting the purity of the &ldquo;intention&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The cunning of this operation is that it divides history into two fields in advance: one is the pure &ldquo;essence&rdquo; or &ldquo;idea&rdquo; that transcends specific historical conditions (the need to adapt to the Marxist system and consolidate the regime), and the other is empirical and accidental &ldquo;reality&rdquo; or &ldquo;execution&rdquo;. When reality conflicts with ideas, what is condemned is always the &ldquo;execution&rdquo; of reality, and the idea itself is suspended unscathed on history. This is exactly the pre-critical and intellectual way of thinking criticized by Hegel: it cannot see that the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; itself arises from the specific and contradictory reality, and the disastrous consequences of the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; in reality expose the internal contradictions and falseness of the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; itself.</p>
<p>Further analyze the vulgar tendency behind this mode of thinking. Simplifying the complex historical process into a static &ldquo;system&rdquo; or &ldquo;mode&rdquo; and judging it as a &ldquo;good/bad&rdquo; binary is itself a &ldquo;pre-reflection&rdquo; posture that abandons dialectical thinking. It avoids the key to the problem: the formation of the Stalin system itself is a process full of violent, accidental and traumatic decisions. It is a &ldquo;forced choice&rdquo; made by the Soviet regime to survive in the siege of capitalism and the spontaneous power of the domestic petty bourgeoisie. It is not a perfect design adapted to the blueprint of Marxism, but a construction full of &ldquo;symptoms&rdquo; - while trying to solve practical contradictions (such as backward industrialization, sharp class struggle), it also spawns new and more fierce contradictions (such as bureaucracy, comprehensive suppression of society by the state, personal worship, etc.). The &ldquo;tramp&rdquo; comrade tried to describe it with instrumental rational language such as &ldquo;adaptability&rdquo; and &ldquo;operable&rdquo;, which itself is a &ldquo;de-politicized&rdquo; strategy, depicting a historical moment full of class struggle and political decision as a technical management problem.</p>
<p>More crucially, the so-called &ldquo;Lenin led the Bolsheviks to eliminate the Socialist Revolution Party has shown that the Great Purge is correct&rdquo;, which is a typical and dangerous historical analogy. The wrong of this methodology is that it equates two events in completely different historical contexts with fundamentally different class contents. After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks&rsquo; suppression of the right-wing social revolutionaries who openly carried out armed rebellions and colluded with the White Army and foreign interferers was an open class war aimed at defending the new Soviet regime. The Great Purge in Stalin&rsquo;s period was a large-scale political movement that lacked clear legal procedures, mainly aimed at the party and within the Soviet, by means of secret police, after the establishment of the socialist system. Mixing the two and ignoring their &ldquo;speciality of contradictions&rdquo; is the embodiment of dogmatism, whose purpose is to use the &ldquo;legal violence&rdquo; in the early stage of the revolution to provide historical legitimacy for the &ldquo;illegal violence&rdquo; in peacetime.</p>
<p>Part II: &ldquo;Qualified Communists&rdquo; - the kindness of the other and the escape of the subject
The comrade&rsquo;s discussion on &ldquo;how to persuade others&rdquo; more clearly exposes the ideological symptom of a subject evading his own mission. He said, &ldquo;As long as supporting communism does not become his enemy, he is a qualified communist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This view seems to be tolerant and pragmatic, but it actually eliminates the subjectivity of communists. In Marx and Lenin, communists are by no means just &ldquo;non-objection&rdquo; people. They are the vanguard of the revolution and &ldquo;the most resolute and always driving part&rdquo;. They theoretically &ldquo;understand the conditions, processes and general results of the proletarian movement&rdquo;. Communism is not a static doctrine that can be passively &ldquo;supported&rdquo;, but a revolutionary practice that requires &ldquo;perseverance and fruitful struggle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This reduction of the &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; standard is actually a cynic gesture. This kind of cynicism seems to abandon the lofty revolutionary ideals on the surface, but it is actually an effective way to maintain the status quo. It said to ordinary people, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be a hero who sacrifices everything for the revolution. You just need to support us in your heart and don&rsquo;t openly oppose us.&rdquo; The real function of this word is to disarm ordinary people from the revolutionary armed forces, so that they can stay on the track of daily life at ease, while retaining a beautiful image of &ldquo;supporting communism&rdquo; in their imagination.</p>
<p>Criticize this view from the perspective of subjective construction. True philosophy or revolutionary practice requires the subject to &ldquo;consciously and even arrogantly create and establish their own way of life activities&rdquo;. The view of this &ldquo;tramp&rdquo; comrade is precisely to let the subject escape this creative and risky activity and retreat to a safe position guaranteed by the &ldquo;other&rdquo; (party, leader, historical inevitability). You don&rsquo;t need to take the initiative to learn, fight and sacrifice. You just need to believe in the &ldquo;good intention&rdquo; other and say &ldquo;no objection&rdquo;, and you can get the status of a &ldquo;qualified communist&rdquo;. This is a typical alienation of the subject: the actions and decisions of the subject are externalized and entrusted to an imaginary authority, and the subject itself becomes an empty symbol that only needs to express its position.</p>
<p>When he said, &ldquo;Some people don&rsquo;t want to be Commists because they are afraid of sacrifice,&rdquo; he fell into the situation he criticized. He simplified the complex ideological struggle into a simple psychological problem (fear of sacrifice), which is a typical &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; ideology. He didn&rsquo;t see that the reason why people were &ldquo;unwilling&rdquo; was not because of simple &ldquo;fear&rdquo;, but because the existing ideological state machine (in Alduser terms) successfully internalized capitalist individualism and consumerist values into their &ldquo;second nature&rdquo; through various channels such as schools, media, families and so on. Therefore, the real task is not to &ldquo;stimulate their most basic collective consciousness&rdquo; (this is another vague psychological term), but to be like Lenin in &ldquo;What to do?&rdquo; As emphasized in it, &ldquo;inculcate&rdquo; scientific socialist consciousness into the workers&rsquo; movement from the outside and carry out a comprehensive and uncompromising struggle against bourgeois ideology.</p>
<p>Conclusion: A kind of &ldquo;de-politicized&rdquo; nostalgia</p>
<p>In a word, the whole set of words of this &ldquo;tramp&rdquo; comrade serves a core ideological function: to beautify a real history full of trauma, contradictions and political decision into a &ldquo;myth&rdquo; that is pure in nature, in the right direction, and only deviates in execution. The ultimate purpose of this operation is to avoid the current revolutionary task.</p>
<p>1.By essentially turning the Stalin system into a &ldquo;good model&rdquo;, he avoided the need for specific and dialectical analysis of the socialist construction road.</p>
<p>2.By rationalizing the Great Purge and other events as &ldquo;the necessary steps to consolidate the regime&rdquo;, he avoided thinking about the core issues of how to deal with internal contradictions under the dictatorship of the proletariat and how to prevent the alienation of power.</p>
<p>3.By lowering the standard of communists to &ldquo;no opposition&rdquo;, he eliminated the need for the hard theoretical indoctrination and organizational work of revolutionary parties, and eventually led to a kind of abolitionism.</p>
<p>This is a kind of &ldquo;depoliticized&rdquo; nostalgia. It is not really learning from history, but turning history into a closed refuge that can be used to escape real political struggles. True loyalty to the past is not to repeat what the past has done, but to repeat the revolutionary posture that makes past actions possible and apply it to the new situation in the present. On the contrary, this comrade was infatuated with the rigid form of the past, but lost the revolutionary core of that form.</p>
<p>Therefore, our criticism must point out that this seemingly &ldquo;left&rdquo; speech is essentially right. Through the romanticization and decontradiction of history, it finally canceled the current revolutionary action. It is not calling on people to become real communist fighters, but to soothe the petty-bourgeois consciousness that wants to have a revolutionary aura and does not want to take revolutionary risks. What it longs for is not the communism of the future, but a past that can never be returned and is imaginatively purified. This is its most profound ideological deception.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Q: What should he do? That is to say, how can he enable people to learn Marxism in reality? After all, his distress is here. You said that &ldquo;instilling&rsquo; scientific socialist consciousness from the outside to the workers&rsquo; movement&rdquo;, but what if he tried to inculcate from the outside, but failed? What do you think of it as an ideological critic?</p>
<p>Comrade, the question you raised is very sharp. It does not touch a simple operation manual question - &ldquo;How to instill effectively?&rdquo;, but a fundamental ideological symptom about subject position and revolutionary strategy. The distress of the &ldquo;Soviet tramp&rdquo; comrade, his seemingly sincere sense of failure, and the solution of &ldquo;lowering the standard&rdquo; he proposed perfectly exposed a pre-reflective, petty-bourgeois-style irritability. As an ideological critic, we can&rsquo;t give him a prescription of &ldquo;how to instill it better&rdquo;, which will only make him slide from the failure of a vulgar practice to another illusion of vulgar practice. What we must do is to tear apart the ideological illusion behind his way of asking questions and force him to face the real problem of his main position.</p>
<p>I. Symptoms of &ldquo;failure in indoctrination&rdquo;: subjective escape and fantasy help to others
You ask, &ldquo;What if he tries to instill from the outside, but fails to cause it?&rdquo; This is a wonderful rhetorical question, but it presupposes the premise: the existence of a pure indoctrination subject (the &ldquo;tragrant&rdquo; comrade) that has mastered the &ldquo;scientific socialist consciousness&rdquo;, and a pure, waiting to be filled indoctrination object (workers&rsquo; masses). The &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is imagined as a technical obstacle, that is, the &ldquo;external&rdquo; tool fails to successfully act on the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; object.</p>
<p>This concept itself is a typical ideological operation. It fictionalies a subject that is external to the struggle. The comrade imagined himself as a teacher or missionary outside the matter, holding a truth Bible called &ldquo;Marxism&rdquo; and trying to &ldquo;give&rdquo; it to the ignorant masses. When the masses refused to accept it, what he felt was not the internal rupture of his theory and the practice of the masses, but a personal frustration of missionary failure.</p>
<p>What is the essence of this frustration? It is a subjective escape. He is unwilling to admit that real &ldquo;indoctrination&rdquo; or revolutionary propaganda has never been a ready-made subject to convey ready-made information to a ready-made object. As Lenin stressed, scientific socialist consciousness must be &ldquo;instilled&rdquo; from the outside to the spontaneous workers&rsquo; movement, which does not mean that several intellectuals take books to preach to workers. This &ldquo;external&rdquo; is not a geographical or identity external, but a theoretical externality. This means that there must be a revolutionary party, which itself is in the most resolute and advanced part of the working class. It organizes workers to carry out all the practice from economic struggle to political struggle, and in the process of struggle, it elevates the spontaneous resistance of workers to a conscious class consciousness.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;failure&rdquo; of this comrade lies in the fact that he pulled himself out of this difficult, complex and contradictory organization and struggle. He imagined &ldquo;persuading others to learn Marxism&rdquo; as a purely verbal act, a kind of logical persuasion or moral persuasion. This failure exposed his impatience as a petty-bourgeois intellectual: he longed for an immediate formula and an ideological shortcut that could bypass the idea of &ldquo;putting organizational work and agitation work first&rdquo;. Just as Heinzen wanted to use a few leaflets to call for the people to revolt, this comrade also wanted to convert the masses to communism with a few words of &ldquo;the original intention is good&rdquo;, which is bound to fail.</p>
<p>Therefore, the truth hidden by the symptom of &ldquo;indoctrination failure&rdquo; is that there is no transcendent subject that can be &ldquo;indoctrinated&rdquo; at all. His so-called &ldquo;trying to inculcate from the outside&rdquo; is just a self-imaginary &ldquo;mimic revolution&rdquo; that lacks the foundation of reality. His distress is essentially a request for help to the imaginary, unimpotent &ldquo;theoretical other&rdquo;: &ldquo;I have read your Bible, why don&rsquo;t they believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>II. What should he do? - A wrong question, a correct criticism</p>
<p>So, when we face &ldquo;What should he do?&rdquo; When it comes to this question, we must refuse to give any instrumental answer. We can&rsquo;t tell him that &ldquo;you should be A, B, C&rdquo;, because it just caters to his desire for ready-made methods, thus consolidating his wrong position. The real Marxist answer must be: you must first give up the question of &ldquo;what should I do&rdquo; and ask &ldquo;who am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rectify his dominant position of the petty bourgeoisie: He must realize that his tolerant attitude of &ldquo;lowering standards&rdquo; and &ldquo;just supporting&rdquo; is not a pragmatic strategy, but a manifestation of his own fear of struggle and isolation of the petty bourgeoisie. He projected his fear of revolutionary risks into the &ldquo;fear of sacrifice&rdquo; of the masses. He must liquidate this ideological trick in the name of the &ldquo;people&rdquo; to hide his weakness. He must give up the liberal logic of &ldquo;as long as you don&rsquo;t become an enemy, you will be a friend&rdquo; and learn from Lenin&rsquo;s teaching: we must divide classes, and we must strictly distinguish between the swing of the petty bourgeoisie and the revolutionary nature of the proletariat.</p>
<p>Give up the dream of a &ldquo;spiritual mentor&rdquo; and devote himself to the &ldquo;most ordinary daily struggle&rdquo;: he must give up the attitude of &ldquo;the philosopher king&rdquo; who stands above the masses and enlightens the masses. Marxists do not use theory to &ldquo;persuade&rdquo; the masses, but to become &ldquo;the most resolute and always driving part&rdquo; in the economic and political struggles of the masses. What should he do? He should not &ldquo;persuade&rdquo; but practice. Go to a factory, participate in the labor of workers, and understand their hardships; in a specific strike or rights protection action, organize leaflets, establish contacts, and analyze the situation. Only in the hot practice of class struggle can he transform the &ldquo;scientific socialism&rdquo; in the book into a living struggle strategy and slogan that can be understood and accepted by the masses. His so-called &ldquo;spire the most basic collective&rdquo;</p>
